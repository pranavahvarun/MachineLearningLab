# Experiment 2: Loan Amount Prediction using Linear Regression

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a Linear Regression model to predict loan amounts based on user features and historical records.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `experiment2.ipynb` â€“ Full code for regression model
- `datasets/` â€“ Contains LoanAmountPrediction.csv
- `screenshots/` â€“ Includes plots (correlation heatmap, residuals, etc.)
- `requirements.txt`

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Summary
| Metric     | Test Set | Cross-Validation Avg |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| MAE        | 27.08    | 28.32                |
| MSE        | 1614.62  | 1668.69              |
| RMSE       | 40.18    | 40.81                |
| RÂ² Score   | 0.817    | 0.810                |

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- Histogram of loan amounts
- Scatter plot: income vs loan
- Residual plot
- Feature importance bar plot
- Actual vs Predicted plot

## ðŸ§ª How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook experiment2.ipynb
